####A barebones HTML5, jQuery and media queries kit.


The best ideas start on a napkin. This is a lightweight development kit for HTML5 and CSS.

I initially created this, so while I'm out and about I can still rapidly create prototypes without an internet connection to download jQuery libraries or reference any meta tags.

##Features:
* Barebones HTML5 template
* Blank CSS with media queries (LESS)
* jQuery 1.x and 2.x (switchable)
* Useful snippets for Facebook Open Graph, Google Analytics, viewport meta, iOS icons, Windows 8 tiles and Favicons
* HTML5 shim
* CSS reset

I have decided to put all snippets into a separate text file with comments in, allowing you to choose exactly what you want to include. The repo will be updated as-and-when jQuery builds are released (stable). Feel free to suggest changes.

Lastly: The LESS files are located in /dev/ and the CSS in /lib/css, thus allowing you to easily keep development code off the server.

There are some basic styles in the CSS, feel free to delete or edit as needed and a Helvetica font stack is included in the _mixins file.

Happy forking!
