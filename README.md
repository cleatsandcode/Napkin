**A barebones HTML5, jQuery and media queries kit.
**

The best ideas start on a napkin. This is a lightweight development kit for HTML% and CSS.

##Features:
* Barebones HTML5 template
* Blank CSS with media queries (LESS/SASS)
* jQuery 1.9.x and 2.0 (switchable)
* Useful snippets for Facebook Open Graph, Google Analytics, viewport meta, iOS icons, Windows 8 tiles and Favicons
* HTML5 shim
* CSS reset

I have decided to put all snippets into a separate text file with comments in, allowing you to choose exactly what you want to include. The repo will be updated as-and-when jQuery builds are released (stable). Feel free to suggest changes.

Happy forking!
